Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet
Each time I hold your little hand
It makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Whether we're standing on your doorstep
Or sitting in a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark
Where I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Give me a cave up in the mountains
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven, honey
If you are there with me
Where I can kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
